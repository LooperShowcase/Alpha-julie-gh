        <h2>The Secret of "Platform 9 ¾":</h2>
        <p><strong>Magical Platform:</strong> Platform 9 ¾ is invisible to the general public, but it exists between platforms 9 and 10 at King's Cross Station. To reach it, one must run quickly towards the wall separating the two platforms and collide with it to be transported to Platform 9 ¾.</p>
        <p><strong>Symbolism of the Magical World:</strong> The number 9 ¾ represents the divide between the world of wizards and the ordinary world. While the ordinary world sees nothing, wizards are able to see and use the platform. It is a symbol of a magical world that is separate but intertwined with the world of humans.</p>
